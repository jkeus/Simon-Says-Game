# Hello Website (blank)

This is a basic static HTML starter project you can build on however you like. No need to save. While you develop your site, your changes will happen ðŸª„ immediately in the preview window. You can upload assets like images or audio in `assets` to the left. The rest is up to you and your imagination.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    Personally, I had some trouble creating the strike system for my web app. I had an initial idea of using a if else statements. But I felt that there was a better way. I remebered that in my java course we used switch statements. So I looked on the w3 schools web page to see is javascript has a simialr feature. Sure enough it did. Another issue was chosing additional colors that fit the palate. What I did was use another website, htmlcolorcodes, that showed me how to better use the color feature. After doing some testing with the website as my guide I was able to find two other colors for the buttons that complemented the original 4.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    My main first about web development is what other langauges can we use to create web apps. I would like to be able to make some webapps using some of the code I made in my cs class. However that code is in Java. My second and last question is how do principles in web application apply to mobile application. To be more specific I mean apps from a app store and not a webpage on a mobile device.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    I have two things that I would do. First is try to work on some more of the optional features. I am interested in the timer and button swap feature. My knowledge in the logic part(javascript) was good enough to do this. But my knowledge in the design part(css, HTML) was lacking. I was unsure how to emplement these features from my script. After a couple of hours of no real progress they were abonded. If I had more time I would want to study more css and html in order to bridge the design and the logic so I can implement these features. The second thing I would do is give it a theme and improve the UI. I was going to chose music. I would do things like have the buttons playback chords form differnet indturments. Also change some of the design elements so that they fit better on a page and had good flow.
